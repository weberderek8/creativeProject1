    <h1>Summary</h1>
    <img src="photos/emuwar.jpg" style="width:100px;height:100px;">
    <p>
      The Emu War, also known as the Great Emu War, was a nuisance wildlife management military operation undertaken in Australia over the latter part of 
      1932 to address public concern over the number of emus said to be running amok in the Campion district of Western Australia. The unsuccessful attempts 
      to curb the population of emus, a large flightless bird indigenous to Australia, employed soldiers armed with Lewis guns—leading the media to adopt 
      the name "Emu War" when referring to the incident. While a number of the birds were killed, the emu population persisted and continued to cause crop destruction.

    <h2>Background</h2>
    <p>
        Following World War I, large numbers of ex-soldiers from Australia, along with a number of British veterans, were given land by the Australian government to 
        take up farming within Western Australia, often in marginal areas. With the onset of the Great Depression in 1929, these farmers were encouraged to increase 
        their wheat crops, with the government promising—and failing to deliver—assistance in the form of subsidies. In spite of the recommendations and the promised 
        subsidies, wheat prices continued to fall, and by October 1932 matters were becoming intense, with the farmers preparing to harvest the season's crop while 
        simultaneously threatening to refuse to deliver the wheat. The difficulties facing farmers were increased by the arrival of as many as 20,000 emus. Emus 
        regularly migrate after their breeding season, heading to the coast from the inland regions. With the cleared land and additional water supplies being made 
        available for livestock by the West Australian farmers, the emus found that the cultivated lands were good habitat, and they began to foray into farm territory—in 
        particular the marginal farming land around Chandler and Walgoolan. The emus consumed and spoiled the crops, as well as leaving large gaps in fences where rabbits 
        could enter and cause further problems. Farmers relayed their concerns about the birds ravaging their crops, and a deputation of ex-soldiers were sent to meet 
        with the Minister of Defence, Sir George Pearce. Having served in World War I, the soldier-settlers were well aware of the effectiveness of machine guns, and they 
        requested their deployment. The minister readily agreed, although with conditions attached: the guns were to be used by military personnel, and troop transport 
        was to be financed by the Western Australian government, and the farmers would provide food, accommodation, and payment for the ammunition. Pearce also supported 
        the deployment on the grounds that the birds would make good target practice, although it has also been argued that some in the government may have viewed this 
        as a way of being seen to be helping the Western Australian farmers, to stave off the secession movement that was brewing at the same time, and towards that end 
        a cinematographer from Fox Movietone was enlisted.
