    <h1>Summary</h1>

    <p>
       Hannibal Barca (/ˈhænɪbəl/; Punic: 𐤇𐤍𐤁𐤏𐤋𐤟𐤁𐤓𐤒, brq ḥnbʿl; 247 – between 183 and 181 BC)[n 1] was a general and statesman 
       from Ancient Carthage who is widely considered one of the greatest military commanders in history. His father, Hamilcar Barca, 
       was a leading Carthaginian commander during the First Punic War (264–241 BC). His younger brothers were Mago and Hasdrubal, and 
       he was brother-in-law to Hasdrubal the Fair; all also commanded Carthaginian armies. Hannibal lived during a period of great tension 
       in the western Mediterranean Basin, triggered by the emergence of the Roman Republic as a great power after it had established its 
       supremacy over Italy. Although Rome had won the First Punic War, revanchism prevailed in Carthage, symbolised by the alleged pledge 
       that Hannibal made to his father never to be a friend of Rome. The Second Punic War broke out in 218 after Hannibal's attack on Saguntum, 
       an ally of Rome in Hispania. He then made his famous military exploit of carrying war to Italy by crossing the Alps with his African elephants. 
       In his first few years in Italy, he won a succession of dramatic victories at the Trebia, Lake Trasimene, and Cannae. He distinguished himself 
       for his ability to determine his and his opponent's respective strengths and weaknesses, and to plan battles accordingly. Hannibal's well-planned 
       strategies allowed him to conquer several Italian cities allied to Rome. Hannibal occupied most of southern Italy for 15 years, but could not win 
       a decisive victory, as the Romans led by Fabius Maximus avoided confrontation with him, instead waging a war of attrition. A counter-invasion of 
       North Africa led by Scipio Africanus forced him to return to Carthage. Scipio had studied Hannibal's tactics and brilliantly devised some of his own, 
       and he finally defeated Rome's nemesis at the Battle of Zama, having previously driven Hannibal's brother Hasdrubal out of the Iberian Peninsula.

    <h2>Name</h2>
    <p>
        The English form of the name is derived from the Latin. Greek historians rendered the name as Anníbas Bárkas (Ἀννίβας Βάρκας).Hannibal was a common 
        Carthaginian masculine given name. The name was recorded in Carthaginian sources as ḥnbʿl[3] (Punic: 𐤇𐤍𐤁𐤏𐤋). It is a combination of the common 
        Carthaginian masculine given name Hanno with the Northwest Semitic Canaanite deity Baal (lit. "The Lord"). Its precise vocalization remains a matter 
        of debate. Suggested readings include Ḥannobaʿal, Ḥannibaʿl, or Ḥannibaʿal, meaning "Baʿal/The Lord is Gracious", "Baʿal Has Been Gracious",[6][7] or 
        "The Grace of Baʿal". Barca (Punic: 𐤁𐤓𐤒, brq) was the Semitic surname of his aristocratic family, meaning "shining" or "lightning".[8] It is thus 
        the Phoenician equivalent to the Arabic name Barq or the Hebrew name Barak or the ancient Greek epithet Keraunos, which was commonly given to military 
        commanders in the Hellenistic period. In English, his clan are sometimes collectively known as the Barcids. As with Greek and Roman practice, patronymics 
        were a common part of Carthaginian nomenclature, so that Hannibal would also have been known as "Hannibal son of Hamilcar"
