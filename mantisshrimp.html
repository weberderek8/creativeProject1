    <h1>Summary</h1>
    <img src="photos/mantisshrimp.jpg" style="width:100px;height:100px;">
    <p>
        Mantis shrimps, or stomatopods, are marine crustaceans of the order Stomatopoda. Some species have specialised calcified "clubs" that 
        can strike with great power, while others have sharp forelimbs used to capture prey. They branched from other members of the 
        class Malacostraca around 410 million years ago. Mantis shrimps typically grow to around 10 cm (3.9 in) in length. A few can reach up to 
        38 cm (15 in). The largest mantis shrimp ever caught had a length of 46 cm (18 in); it was caught in the Indian River near Fort Pierce, 
        Florida, in the United States. A mantis shrimp's carapace (the bony, thick shell that covers crustaceans and some other species) covers 
        only the rear part of the head and the first four segments of the thorax. Varieties range from shades of brown to vivid colors, as more 
        than 450 species of mantis shrimps are known. They are among the most important predators in many shallow, tropical and subtropical marine 
        habitats. However, despite being common, they are poorly understood, as many species spend most of their lives tucked away in burrows and holes.

    <h2>Ecology</h2>
    <p>
        Around 451 species of mantis shrimps have currently been discovered worldwide; all living species are in the suborder Unipeltata.
        These aggressive and typically solitary sea creatures spend most of their time hiding in rock formations or burrowing intricate 
        passageways in the sea bed. They rarely exit their homes except to feed and relocate, and can be active during the day, nocturnal, 
        or active primarily at twilight, depending on the species. Unlike most crustaceans, they sometimes hunt, chase, and kill prey. 
        Although some live in temperate seas, most species live in tropical and subtropical waters in the Indian and Pacific Oceans 
        between eastern Africa and Hawaii.
